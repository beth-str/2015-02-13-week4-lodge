We haven't gone over it yet. But the gist of it is that you would write a method for the class from which you want to run the operation. 

E.g. `Article` has an instance method called (for example) `#add_keyword(keyword_id)`, and when you add the keyword using that method, the SQL inside it adds a row to the "articles_keyword" join table with values for that article's ID and the `keyword_id`. But again, we don't expect you to handle this just yet (though it's not _totally_ outside your abilities).
